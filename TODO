    Narration?

SUNDAY OBJECTIVE: Add new mechanics to make it more fun, sumbit to itch.io
NOT ALL SUNDAY OBJECTIVES MUST (or should) BE IMPLEMENTED
1. Make Walls
    Figure out what thematically makes sense for a wall
    If player swims to wall, block movement
    If player jumps to wall, [cancel jump | cut jump short | 
        make a bonk effect and fall down | 
        auto-jump to kick player out (if the surface hurts froggy)]
    If player jumps through wall, [Allow it if legal target | cancel jump |
        same as jump to wall | bonk]
2. Eat Flies [(#2 or #6) AND #3 CODEPENDENT]
    (This will have no practical function until No. 3)
    Make Fly sprite
    Make Fly prefab
    Make fly go in random directions within a circle
    Frog RMB will:
        Quickly Extend and retract Toungue to eat fly (limited range)
        Croak.wav if fly not targeted with mouse (spam this for a fun time)
3. Make Energy Meter [(#2 or #6) AND #3 CODEPENDENT]
    Jumping Drains according to jump distance
    Swimming Drains it
    Eating Flies regains it
    Passive regen
    No energy = No movement
    No energy in water = move REALLY slowly
    No energy + Witch Nearby = You're SOL my friend
4. Make fake Lilypad
    An illusion created by the witch
    Very similar look to regular lilypad
    Landing on this [submerges you | inhibits jump charge and energy usage]
    Witch voiceline when landing ("You're just as smart as you look (cackle)")
5. Make Super Lilypads
    make sprite (color swap or icon on pad)
    Increases jump range/charge speed for lower energy cost
    Zooms camera out to reveal more of the world
6. Make Recharge Lilypad [REQS #3]
    make sprite (color swap / icon)
    Alternative to #2 if it takes too long
    Dramatically increases passive energy regen
    [Only regens when idle (not charging) | recharges set amount once upon landing |
        recharges the entire time]
7. Correct Path / Dead Ends [REQS #1]
    To reach the end, you must follow the correct branching paths
    Correct path indicated by [Arrow | Confusing Text Generator from bomb game |
        not indicated | something else?]
    When hitting dead end, [you're just SOL | Super Lilypad gets you back to main course |
        something else gets you on correct path, but you lose all energy | 
        gotta go back, but dead end is shallow so you could still make it]
